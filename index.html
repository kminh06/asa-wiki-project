					Hi! My name is Khac Minh and I’m a 9th Grader. For the past 2 quarters participating in Concordia’s Coding Club ASA, I’ve been learning web development and applying my knowledge by making some fun side projects. For the past couple of weeks, I’ve been working on this website that you’re currently viewing, but I would also like to present to you an app that I recently created. This is a very well-built To-Do List app that helps you with reminding and organizing every-day tasks and it’s really simple to use. You can access the app <a href="https://kminh06.github.io/todoapp" target="_blank">here</a>.

									The BT tanks or 'Bystrokhodny tanks' (Russian for: "fast moving tanks") were a series of light tanks of the Soviet Union that was produced in large quantities from 1932 to 1941. It saw service from the Spanish Civil War to the Second World War. These tanks were known to be able to boast speeds up to 52 km/h and 72 km/h(on wheels) on road giving its ablility to perform ridiculous stunts like longest jump done by a tank. Eventhough many were produced, only a few BTs remained today and even fewer are in working conditions as many were destroyed. Although perhaps it is a tank that is not remembered for its success, it did lay the foundations for the design of the more famous Soviet T-34.

								<h3>Design and The Christie Suspension</h3>
								<hr>

							<div class="boring-side">
								<p>
									The BT tanks, although a Soviet tank was not a Soviet invention, but an American one designed by J. Walter Christie. When Christie was designing military vehicles, he became interested in the idea of a ‘convertible’ tank laying design. Earlier tanks were very prone to break down with their tracks, only being able to move less than 1 km. This means these tanks have to be transported to the battlefield which was not very cheap to do. Christie solve this problem by designing a system that uses tracks when crossing the countryside but could be removed for longer travels on the road. In his M 1928 tank design, he used the revolutionary Christie suspension, because it uses a large coil spring that absorbs more impact on rough terrain. The large coil springs were extremely fast and lightweight which allows the BT tanks to go at incredible speeds and achieve ridiculous stunts like the longest tank jump. The tank could also remove its tracks and be steered using its frontal wheels which is one of the tank most notable characteristics. Although it sounds like a weird design choice, as mentioned before, this was so that the BT tank can travel at longer distances on road without damaging its tracks. Although it is worth noting that before working for the military, Christie was a racing car designer which probably explains why the BT have the ability to drive on wheels. However, the Christie suspension has some flaws. Maintenance was a painful task, it has a tendency to shred the tracks due to the excessive sag in the track, and most importantly it took up a lot of space inside the tank. Although it might be the result of the limited materials back then, but even with new modern materials, the suspension still took up a lot of space.

								<h3>Shipping to the Soviet Union and the BT-2</h3>
								<hr>

							<div class="boring-side">
								<p>
									Although revolutionary, Christie's M 1928 design after being tested by the US Army, wasn't accepted as it didn't fit the army doctrine and lack of funding. It was also the beginning of the Great Depression so it was even hard for Christie to sell his tanks to the army. So Christie sold his tank to foreign nations, one of these nations was the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union received Christie's M 1928, they found that the tanks that they were sent have many problems. Not only did the tank does not have a turret, but its transmission and engine is also unreliable, the running gear broke several times after running at a very short distance, and it was difficult to handle. So the Soviets completely redeveloped the tank, but keeping the hull and Christie’s suspension, to be more reliable and service worthy. From 1932 to 1933, 620 tanks were built but production stopped when it is replaced by the BT-5.

								<h3>BT-5 and BT-7 plus other variats</h3>
								<hr>

							<div class="boring-side">
								<p>
									The BT-5 was fitted with a better turret with a 45mm cannon, a better M-5 Liberty engine and was generally more reliable and service worthy. There were plans to match the turret of the T-26 and BT-5 together to make production effcient and standardised but they ended up producing 2 different types of turrets. This is then changed with the development of the BT-7. Along with an even better engine, a muffler is installed at the back, and its frontal armour was welded instead of riveted. The turret of the BT-7 at first uses the same turret as the BT-5 before but was then switch with the turret of the T-26. The turret was sloped which provides a bit better protection, but more importantly it made the production of the T-26 and BT-7 easier. The improved engine although gave good results but did not increase its speed as more weight was added to the tank. From 1933 to 1939, thousands of the BT-7 built. The BT-7M adds a new V-2 diesel engine which made it able to accelerate to its top speed faster. There were some foreign variations, one notable variation is the Finnish BT-42 which was a BT-7 fitted with 4.5 inch howitzer. The tank was ok at destroying Soviet fortification but terrible in the anti-tank role. The tank was disliked by their crew for its high profile and difficult handling, and saw little service life.

								<h3>Operational History</h3>
								<hr>
							</div>
							<div class="boring-side">
								<h3>Spainish Civil War</h3>
								<p>
									A BT tanks were sent to the Republican side of the Spanish Civil War. However because of poor tactics, many were lost.
								</p>
								<h3>Mongolian Border Conflict</h3>
								<p>
									Many BT-tank were reported to caught fire very easily by Japanese molotov-cocktails because of the hot climate of Mongolia. But overal the BT tanks saw better performance in the battle of Khalkin Gol as it played its role as an offensive tank.
								</p>
								<h3>Winter War</h3>
								<p>
									The BT tanks in Finland suffered performance as they weren't able to move very well through the dense forest of Finland.
								</p>

								<h3>Second World War</h3>
								<p>
									The BT tanks suffered poorly during the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The BT tanks was a tank that is supposed to be used in the offensive role, not defensive role which it lacks with its very thin armour. The tank also suffered from poor Soviet operational command and tactics during the early phases of the war also. As a result of these, the Soviets lost the BT tanks in high numbers. This is why eventhough thousands were produced, not many survived the war and even fewer are even in working condition.
